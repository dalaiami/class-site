  <div class="poem">
    <p>Personification is inevitable. It goes hand</p>

    <p>-in-hand with reinventing the wheel.
      It reeks of misfortune. Gives a mess</p>

    <p>its mass. Is why slime
      never forgets</p>

    <p> its shapelessness,
      while memory</p>

    <p> foam must, in what doesn’t leave
      an impression. My memory spins</p>

    <p> our negative capabilities round,
      round, like a record the dead</p>

    <p> once held, as if listening were human</p>

    <p> invention. Imagine someone who only touched
      needle to vinyl. That generation who lost things</p>

    <p> as memories, while I run from thunder,
      huddle inside a train long gone</p>

    <p> off the rails. I call for an Uber. A call
      I did not even place. It’s all part</p>

    <p> of this new deal, for which I am the delay.
      Oh, blissful ooze. Oh, quantum soldier</p>

    <p> of fortune. There will be an app for judgment
      that we can’t delete. You correct me:</p>

    <p> execution. Let’s get into this. That sentencing
      is quite empty. The sentence is doubling</p>

    <p> down. Computerication is enviable. I’m pretty
      beetles you’d like to stick a pin through</p>

    <p> & then trash can. Why care
      for the shepherd tricked</p>

    <p> into the slaughter pen. Let’s get it out in the open.
      Herds. Human. Break. Bliss. Silo. Haze. Quant-</p>

    <p> ify looking forward. To tomorrow, to block
      me from negative space. Mince this</p>

    <p> tender. Say slime can be a crown
      of onions & it cries into my eyes.</p>

    <p> Say chop away at wing & antenna.
      Say leave me alone with my own</p>

    <p> device. Say I’ll refuse rubber shell
      & puckered mutton. I try & reinvent</p>

    <p> new spin. It’s a table with too
      many hands in it. It’s communal</p>

    <p> as plague. It’s that you were invented,
      but came first. The wheel who’ll originate</p>

    <p> the hands that spin it. Say they only reach
      a single herd so milky & sweet. Say it grazes</p>

    <p> from beneath the screen,
      free of my cutting board,</p>

    <p> where you’re filtering all
      of my chemical elements,</p>

    <p> until I’m a looted grave, a generic
      greeting for the slaughterhouse &</p>

    <p> day of rest. Say until I press
      the air</p>

    <p> like a switch
      & ask: when.</p>

    <p> Say you keep all the bells
      tolling & line every fence</p>

    <p> in the schoolyard with birds of prey.
      Say no car can escape into spacecraft</p>

    <p> or credits.
      & you cut</p>

    <p> to blank,
      cursor still</p>

    <p> swarming over
      whatever dares next.</p>
