        <br /><p>Personification is inevitable. It goes hand</p>

                <p><br />-in-hand with reinventing the wheel.
                <br />It reeks of misfortune. Gives a mess</p>

                <p><br />its mass. Is why slime
              <br /> never forgets</p>

                <p><br />its shapelessness,
                <br />while memory</p>

                <p><br />foam must, in what doesn’t leave
                <br />an impression. My memory spins</p>

                <p><br />our negative capabilities round,
                <br />round, like a record the dead</p>

                <p><br />once held, as if listening were human</p>

                <p><br />invention. Imagine someone who only touched
                <br />needle to vinyl. That generation who lost things</p>

                <p><br />as memories, while I run from thunder,
                <br />huddle inside a train long gone</p>

                <p><br />off the rails. I call for an Uber. A call
                <br />I did not even place. It’s all part</p>

                <p><br />of this new deal, for which I am the delay.
                <br />Oh, blissful ooze. Oh, quantum soldier</p>

                <p><br />of fortune. There will be an app for judgment
                <br />that we can’t delete. You correct me:</p>

                <p><br />execution. Let’s get into this. That sentencing
                <br />is quite empty. The sentence is doubling</p>

                <p><br />down. Computerication is enviable. I’m pretty
                <br />beetles you’d like to stick a pin through</p>

                <p><br />& then trash can. Why care
                <br />for the shepherd tricked</p>

                <p><br />into the slaughter pen. Let’s get it out in the open.
                <br />Herds. Human. Break. Bliss. Silo. Haze. Quant-</p>

                <p></br><br />ify looking forward. To tomorrow, to block
                <br />me from negative space. Mince this</p>

                <p><br />tender. Say slime can be a crown
                <br />of onions & it cries into my eyes.</p>

                <p><br />Say chop away at wing & antenna.
                <br />Say leave me alone with my own</p>

                <p><br />device. Say I’ll refuse rubber shell
                <br />& puckered mutton. I try & reinvent</p>

                <p><br />new spin. It’s a table with too
                <br />many hands in it. It’s communal</p>

                <p><br />as plague. It’s that you were invented,
                <br />but came first. The wheel who’ll originate</p>

                <p></p><br />the hands that spin it. Say they only reach
                <br />a single herd so milky & sweet. Say it grazes</p>

                <p><br />from beneath the screen,
                <br />free of my cutting board,</p>

                <p><br />where you’re filtering all
                <br />of my chemical elements,</p>

                <p><br />until I’m a looted grave, a generic
                <br />greeting for the slaughterhouse &</p>

                <p><br />day of rest. Say until I press
                <br />the air</p>

                <p><br />like a switch
                <br />& ask: when.</p>

                <p><br />Say you keep all the bells
                <br />tolling & line every fence</p>

                <p><br />in the schoolyard with birds of prey.
                <br />Say no car can escape into spacecraft</p>

                <p><br />or credits.
                <br />& you cut</p>

                <p><br />to blank,
                <br />cursor still</p>

                <p><br />swarming over
                <br />whatever dares next.</p>
